Julian Clayton Weekly Log 10
=====================================

- Changed how Beacons are stored locally and on the server. Originally they were stored with a key that was just the sender ID
	The new format for Beacon Keys:

	{SENDER_USER_ID}_{TIMESTAMP_IN_MILLIS}_private 

        - With private ommitted if it is a public Beacon
