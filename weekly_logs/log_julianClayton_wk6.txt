WEEK 6 LOG, Julian Clayton
==================================
- Fixed various isues including seeing duplicates of public beacons (3 hrs)
- Photo sharing. Each beacon can have a photo of users location attached to it. This took a little while to figure out the best way to do this. There are a few little bugs still 
  left with it. I will fix this in the coming week. This is the last of our major features and the remaining time will be used to clean up the application and make 
  it more user friendly (8 hrs)
